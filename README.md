# NeoCampus

Academic project using Database and Server/Client broadcast system. We used Java sockets and JDBC/SQL for the database. Everyvody uses the same software, there is a different UI depending on your rights, siply user or administrator.
An administrator can manage discussions and group members, or create new one. Every user can send a message to any groups. Every message is acknowledged by the server and every user can see who has seen the message. Also, if an user isn't online, the message will still be displayed when he connects again, with a notification.
